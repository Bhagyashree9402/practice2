# Coffee Logs

## Description

A coffee diary to record new roasts or flavors users find. Inspired by being Introduced to new flavors by Red Bay Coffee.

## Inspiration

My girlfriend introduced me to red bay coffee and I was hooked after experimenting with their different roasts. I wanted to start a coffee roast diary to keep track of the new flavors but thought it would be more efficient to make a web app for the purpose instead.
